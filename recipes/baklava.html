    <h1>Baklava</h1>
    <p>Originating from the Ottoman Empire, Baklava was a rich dessert enjoyed across the Middle East and Eastern
        Europe. It features layered phyllo pastry, nuts, and syrup or honey. Its name comes from the Ottoman Turkish
        word baklava, though its exact origins are a subject of culinary debate.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phyllo dough</li>
        <li>Nuts (commonly walnuts, pistachios, or almonds)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Honey or simple syrup</li>
        <li>Spices (usually cinnamon or clove)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice (used in the syrup)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Make the Garlicky Tahini sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, puree the garlic with the tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, water, salt, and pepper until
            smooth. If the sauce appears thick, add a little more water. Scrape the sauce into a bowl, sprinkle with the
            parsley.</li>
        <li>Grease your baking dish with butter.</li>
        <li>Place a rolled puff pastry sheet into the greased pan and spread some butter over it.</li>
        <li>Layer another puff pastry on top and spread butter over it as well.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix the coarsely chopped pistachios, honey, sugar, and water. Pour this mixture evenly
            over the puff pastry sheets in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer another puff pastry sheet over the mixture, spreading butter over it.</li>
        <li>Place the final puff pastry on top and pour any remaining butter over it.</li>
        <li>With a sharp knife, cut the baklava into your preferred shape, such as a diamond or square.</li>
        <li>Put the baklava in the preheated oven and bake for 90 minutes. You’ll know it’s ready when the top has
            turned a light golden color and the pastry appears crispy.</li>
        <li>While the baklava is baking, grind or finely chop the remaining pistachios.</li>
        <li>Once baked, allow the baklava to cool, then garnish with the ground pistachios.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The beauty of this baklava recipe lies in its simplicity. It appears that much of Turkish cuisine shares this
        quality – simple to prepare, yet strikingly presented with mouthwatering flavors. For this recipe, I sourced
        pistachios directly from Turkey, which seemingly enhanced the overall taste.</p>
