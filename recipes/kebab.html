    <h1>Kebab</h1>
    <p>Turkish pit masters devised an ingenious "divide and conquer" approach to shish kebabs: They grill the meat and
        vegetables separately to allow foods with different cooking times to reach the perfect degree of doneness. Serve
        with a creamy tahini sauce.

    <h3>Shish Kebabs</h3>

        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried mint</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large yellow bell pepper, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for the grill</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges and pita bread, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Make the Garlicky Tahini sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, puree the garlic with the tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, water, salt, and pepper until
            smooth. If the sauce appears thick, add a little more water. Scrape the sauce into a bowl, sprinkle with the
            parsley.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Make the Shish Kebabs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the garlic with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon juice, salt, pepper, dried
            mint, and oregano. Add the lamb, toss to coat, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or for up to 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Thread the lamb onto skewers, placing 1 fresh mint leaf between the pieces of meat. Skewer alternate pieces
            of onion and bell pepper and brush lightly with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Light a grill. Lightly brush the grate with vegetable oil and grill the lamb and vegetables over a
            medium-hot fire, turning frequently, until the lamb is medium, about 6 minutes, and the vegetables are
            tender and lightly charred, about 8 minutes. Let the kebabs stand for 2 minutes, then serve with the
            Garlicky Tahini, lemon wedges, and pita bread.</li>
    </ol>
